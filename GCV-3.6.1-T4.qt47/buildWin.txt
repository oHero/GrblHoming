To build the executable under Windows, you must have

1- a 'Qt' version installed and compiled,
	the tests were performed with 'Qt-4.7.3' or 'Qt-5.2'.

2- a 'libQGlViever' version installed in 'Qt', the tests were performed with 'QGlViewer-2.5.2'.
	- 'path_Qt\include\QGlviewer'  received all include
	- 'path_Qt\lib\libQGLViewer2.a  (libQGLViewerd2.a)
	- 'path_Qt\bin\QGLViewer2.dll (QGLViewerd2.dll)

3- 'mingw32' installed to use 'mingw32-make.exe',
	the tests were performed with 'MinGw32-TDM-4.7.1' or  'MinGw32-4.8'

You have to adapt the file 'mw.bat' for the paths are correct.

Example for Qt4 :
	rem Qt4
	set PATH_QT=u:\DONNEES\SVN_COMPILE\qt\4.7.3\
	set PATH_MINGW32o:\DevCpp\MinGw32-TDM\

	rem Qt5
	rem set PATH_QT=o:\DevCpp\Qt-5.3\5.2.0\mingw48_32\
	rem set PATH_MINGW32=o:\DevCpp\Qt-5.3\Tools\mingw48_32\

Open a DOS console and
1 - mw.bat
2 - execute.bat

if you want the French translation
3 - translate.bat
4 - execute.bat
